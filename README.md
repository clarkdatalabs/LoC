# Mapping Library of Congress Records by Subject Location

> by Daniel Tanner


Last May, the US Library of Congress made the largest [release](https://www.si.umich.edu/news/library-congress-opened-its-catalogs-why-it-matters#gsc.tab=0) of digital records in its history â€“ metadata for over 25 million books, maps and recordings. People immediately started making some pretty cool visualizations to explore [patterns in the data](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2017/05/a-brief-visual-history-of-marc.html), or demonstrate the [incredible size](https://medium.com/@thisismattmiller/library-of-congress-lists-57ddd177f1e2?loclr=blogsig) of the release. This page follows my process of building an animated D3 map visualization, from data cleaning to adding features. Each of the pages below covers one step in the process.
