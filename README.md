# Mapping Library of Congress Records

> by Daniel Tanner


Last May, the US Library of Congress made the largest [release](https://www.si.umich.edu/news/library-congress-opened-its-catalogs-why-it-matters#gsc.tab=0) of digital records in its history â€“ metadata for over 25 million books, maps and recordings. People immediately started making some pretty cool visualizations to explore [patterns in the data](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2017/05/a-brief-visual-history-of-marc.html), or demonstrate the [incredible size](https://medium.com/@thisismattmiller/library-of-congress-lists-57ddd177f1e2?loclr=blogsig) of the release. I set out to design a geospatial exploration of the data, with the primary goal of learning a few technologies along the way. This post catalogs some of the challenges in processing the data into a format useful for a D3 powered mapping visualization.
